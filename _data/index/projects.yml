- name: Mail & SMS Spam Detection
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/wprazuch/spam-detection
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/spam_detection.jpg
  desc: In this project I built a deep learning model to detect spam from sms and e-mail messages. Additionally, I provided some EDA for the data. I have also created a simple endpoint in Flask to communicate with the model.

- name: Face Mask Detection
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/wprazuch/face-mask-detection
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/face_mask_detection.jpg
  desc: In this project, I created a face mask detection system that checks, whether a person wears a face mask or not. Again, you can communicate with the model using REST API written in Flask - an example client is shown in the repo.
  
- name: Automatic Stack Exchange Tagging
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/wprazuch/stack-overflow-tags
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/automatic_stack_exchange_tagging.png
  desc: The intention of the project was to create an automated way of tagging questions raised by users on Stack Exchange.

- name: Netflix Movie Recommendation
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/wprazuch/netflix-movie-recommendation
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/netflix_movie_recommendation.jpeg
  desc: Using data provided by Netflix, the goal is to give recommendations of the movies for the user of specific track of movies and ratings.

- name: Handwriting Recognition
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/wprazuch/handwriting-recognition
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/handwriting_recognition.jpg
  desc: The goal was to automatically translate from written text to electronic text, based on CV techniques and Deep Learning.

- name: Face Recognition
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/wprazuch/face-recognition
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/face_recognition.jpg
  desc: The goal of the project was to recognize faces given in the photo. A pretrained face recognition model was used to generate embeddings for each face provided.

- name: IMDb Movie Reviews
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/wprazuch/imdb-movie-reviews
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/imdb_movie_reviews.png
  desc: This project showed how to build a model for a simple Sentiment Analysis task for IMDb Movie Reviews data.

- name: Dog Breed Classification
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/wprazuch/dog-expert
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/dog_expert.jpg
  desc: This project involved building a classification model that would enable to classify dogs in terms of breeds. Stanford dogs dataset was used in the project.

- name: Deep Learning from Scratch
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/wprazuch/deep-learning-from-scratch
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/deep_learning_from_scratch.png
